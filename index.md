# Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! Here you'll find a collection of my data science projects.
   
## Projects
   
### Project 01: [Ant Colony Simulation](projects/ant-colony-simulation.md)
A computational framework simulating competing ant colonies based on Conway's Game of Life principles. This simulation-based project demonstrates how complex collective behaviors emerge from simple individual rules in decentralized multi-agent systems.
