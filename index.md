## Projects
   
### Project 01: [Ant Colony Simulation]([/vicc-dat/projects/ant-colony-simulation/](https://vicc-dat.github.io/vicc-dat/projects/ant-colony-simulation.html))
A computational framework simulating competing ant colonies based on Conway's Game of Life principles. This simulation-based project demonstrates how complex collective behaviors emerge from simple individual rules in decentralized multi-agent systems.
